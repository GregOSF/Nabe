# Nabe

## Description

Nabe provides travelers with a side-by-side, city-to-city comparison of their respective neighborhoods. Users can go to new cities, and see which neighborhoods are most like neighborhoods in the cities they are familiar with. Each neighborhood contains several tags and descriptors which compare against each other, allowing users to see and visit a neighborhood they feel is similar to one they already know.
